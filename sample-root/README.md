# Sample Travel Notes

This folder is a small markdown knowledge base for planning a multi-country trip.
It is meant to be read in the Mindex UI as a demo dataset.

## Quick Index
- [Itinerary](itinerary.md)
- [Budget sketch](logistics/budget.md)
- [Packing checklist](logistics/packing.md)
- [Food notes](notes/food.md)
- [Language notes](notes/language.md)
- [France](destinations/france.md)
- [Italy](destinations/italy.md)
- [Japan](destinations/japan.md)

> Rule of thumb: plan half a day, leave half a day.
