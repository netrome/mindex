# France

## Paris Focus
- Walk the riverfront early in the morning
- Pick two major museums, not all of them
- Plan a neighborhood day: cafes, parks, small shops

## History Notes
- Paris grew around the river, which shaped trade and travel
- Many city plans reflect centuries of rebuilding and redesign

## Day Trips
- Versailles for palace history
- A smaller town for markets and slower pace
