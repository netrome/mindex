# Food Notes

## Planning Ideas
- Identify one local market per city
- Balance quick street food with a few sit-down meals

> If the menu is a maze, order the daily special and take notes.

## Market Roulette
- [ ] Pick one market stall with the longest line
- [ ] Pick one stall with the shortest line
- [ ] Compare notes over a late snack
  - keep it under `15` minutes of debate

## Taste Tracker
| City | Dish | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paris | onion soup | rainy-day comfort |
| Rome | carbonara | no cream, ever |
| Tokyo | ramen | broth first, noodles second |
