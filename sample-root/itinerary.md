# Draft Itinerary

## Goals
- Balance history, food, and nature
- Limit long travel days
- Keep one free day per city

## Rough Order
1. France: Paris and day trips
2. Italy: Rome and Florence
3. Japan: Tokyo and Kyoto

## Draft Schedule Table
| Week | Base | Focus | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Paris | Museums and river walks | [France](destinations/france.md) |
| 2 | Rome | Ancient sites and food | [Italy](destinations/italy.md) |
| 3 | Tokyo | Neighborhood days | [Japan](destinations/japan.md) |

## Daily Rhythm (pseudo)
```text
AM: choose one anchor activity
PM: wander a new neighborhood
EVE: write a 3-line recap
```

## Tickets and Timed Entries
- [ ] Louvre or Orsay (pick one)
- [ ] Colosseum (early slot)
- [ ] TeamLab or similar light show

## Cross-Links
- [Food notes](notes/food.md)
- [Language notes](notes/language.md)

## Open Questions
- Which museums need timed tickets?
- Should we add a short beach stop?
- How many travel days feel comfortable?

## Push Directives (sample)
/notify
```toml
to = "marten"
at = "2025-01-07T21:00:00Z"
message = "Review the itinerary before booking."
```
