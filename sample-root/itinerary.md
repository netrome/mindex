# Draft Itinerary

## Goals
- Balance history, food, and nature
- Limit long travel days
- Keep one free day per city

## Rough Order
1. France: Paris and day trips
2. Italy: Rome and Florence
3. Japan: Tokyo and Kyoto

## Open Questions
- Which museums need timed tickets?
- Should we add a short beach stop?
- How many travel days feel comfortable?
